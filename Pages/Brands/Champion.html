<h2>Champion Oil Filters</h2>

<h4>Why choose Champion?</h4>

<p>Champion motorcycle filters are precision-engineered to match or exceed OE standards. They are made from the highest quality materials and manufactured to exacting standards ensuring virtually zero defects. On the road (and off the road) they deliver maximum performance with unrivalled protection.</p>

<h4>Advantages of choosing Champion</h4>

<h5>Extended life</h5>
<p>Independent tests, (ISO 4548 - oil, and ISO5011 - air) have shown that Champion filters outperform the competition. We guarantee quality across our entire motorcycle filter program.</p>

<h5>Superior Performance</h5>
<p>Our filter paper is unique and impregnated with resin that removes even the most damaging contaminants from the oil. Pleated, cured and mechanically joined to guarantee 100% filtration.</p>

<p>Impregnated with sophisticated fibres ensuring rigidity, good tensile and burst strength</p>
<p>Layers of fibres integrated across each other give the paper depth and structure</p>
<p>Filter paper traps particles on the surface and also locks them inside the media allowing far fewer particles through the engine</p>

<h4>Life Cycle Efficiency</h4>

<p>Tests carried out by independent source according to industry standard ISO 4548/4. The graph clearly shows that the Champion filter filters more efficiently than the competitor's filter.</p>
