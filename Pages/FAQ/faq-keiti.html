			Your fuel tank can get scratched and scuffed easily from every day wear and tear and this can detract from the looks of your bike, as well as lowering its value.<br>
			Motorcycle leathers and tank bags can all cause wear and tank pads are a simple way of protecting the paintwork on your tank.<br>
			Motorcycle tank pads can also provide you with extra grip to help you maintain control when steering and braking.

		<div id="panel1c" class="content">

			<span class="pnl-lbl">Where do you stick tank pads?</span>
		</a>
		<div id="panel1d" class="content">
			There are different types of tank pads available and these are designed to fit to different parts of your tank. Spine tank protectors go right down the middle of the tank and protect the paintwork from scuffs caused by clothes rubbing against the tank.<br>
			These are the most common form and are widely available.<br>
			You can also get a number of different shaped pads to fit around the tank including rounds, kidneys and strips.<br>
			These are useful for providing extra grip for your legs and will also help to protect the paintwork more effectively if you want to fit a tank bag.

		</a>
		<div id="panel1e" class="content">
			The finish on your paintwork can be slippery and this means that you will be putting all of your weight onto your arms and wrists as you are riding.<br>
			One way to ease wrist and shoulder fatigue is to invest in some tank pads.<br>
			These provide more grip for your chest and knees against the tank and allow you to brace yourself more effectively when cornering and braking.<br>
			This relieves the amount of pressure you are putting on your arms and can help to ease wrist and shoulder fatigue.<br>
			This is particularly important if you are carrying a passenger as their weight can also be transferred to you as you ride which can increase the strain on your own body.

			<span class="pnl-lbl">Are tank protectors resistant to sunlight?</span>
		</a>
		<div id="panel1f" class="content">
			Motorcycle tank protector options are designed to be resistant to both UV light and petrol.<br>
			This ensures that they are long lasting and durable. However it is important to note that you should avoid leaving your bike out in direct sunlight for long periods of time.<br>
			Although motorcycle tank protector options and paintwork are designed to be UV resistant, long term exposure to this strong form of radiation can cause fading.<br>
			Although you can just replace the pads, faded paint will be much more difficult to deal with and can make your bike look old before its time.

		</a>
		<div id="panel1g" class="content">
			The most important thing about tank pads is that they are designed to be easily removable so that you can take them off without damaging the paintwork.<br>
			Although motorcycle tank pads may look very easy to replicate it is difficult to copy the manufacturer's methods of making them stick down properly.<br>
			If you try this at home you will either get a tank pad that comes off too easily or one that will not come off at all.<br>
			If you do want to create your own pads then you can buy tank pad sets which provide you with special adhesive sheets so you can cut the exact size moulding you want to protect your tank.

		</a>
		<div id="panel1h" class="content">
			Standard tank pads are around 0.5mm to 1.5mm thick and these provide adequate protection for your paintwork against scrapes, scratches and scuffs.<br>
			If you use your bike for track days then you may want to think about slightly thicker tank pads that will be able to offer more protection against minor spills and also provide you with more grip for extreme cornering and braking.

		</a>
		<div id="panel1j" class="content">
			Tank pads are designed to be removed easily so that you can replace them or restore your bike to original condition quickly.<br>
			The easiest way to remove old tank pads is to warm them gently with a hair dryer or hot air gun (not too hot or you will damage the paintwork).<br>
			The heat will loosen the glue so that you can gently peel the pad off.<br>
			Then you can give the tank a good clean afterwards to remove any last traces of glue.
