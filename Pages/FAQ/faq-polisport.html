		</a>
		<div id="panel11" class="content">
			If you are going to be using your motorbike off-road then you do need to put in place some additional protection for key motorcycle parts such as the forks.  Linkint.com.au provides a wide range of dirt bike plastics such as fork protectors for leading makes and models.  Fork protectors are affordable and easy to fit.  They can help to protect the more expensive fork legs and callipers from knocks and scrapes during competition events or when you are just having some off-road fun.  Fork protectors are just one of those essential motorcycle partsthat are widely available and can provide your dirt bike with that authentic factory look.

		</a>
		<div id="panel12" class="content">
			Fork protectors are quite easy to fit and you will not have to remove any motorcycle parts to do this.  Fitting will depend on what make and model of bike you have.  Fork protectors will come in a standard kit in most cases that you will need to fit yourself.  You will not need a high skill level to do this and each kit will come with full installation instructions.  For example standard plastic kits for a GasGas dirt bike (125, 250 or 450) can offer fork protectors which take only a few steps to fit:<br>
			- Fit the spacer into the front wheel spindle box end (throttle side) and loosely connect the larger nut to the larger spindle bar end.  <br>
			- Push the washer in place behind the nut and then slide the protector (with the larger hole) up to the nut. <br>
			- Put the assembly through to spacer already fitted to the box end and push through the hollow spindle.  Place the other protector over the exposed spindle bar end.<br>
			- Now fit the smaller nuts and washers to the spindle bar end.<br>
			- Use a socket on either end and tighten up until the assembly locks in place.  Make sure you don't tighten this up too much; it should be firmly in place but still able to flex in response to the bike's movement.

		</a>
		<div id="panel13" class="content">
			You do need to replace your rear fender if it is damaged or broken. Not only does the rear fender keep your back from getting splattered with mud and water but it will also help to prevent you from spraying mud in the face of the riders behind you.  This is not a competitive advantage, just plain bad sportsmanship!  New rear fenders are one of those widely available motocross plastics parts and are affordable and easy to replace.  Linkint.com.au offers a number of affordable replacement plastics for dirt bikes.

			<span class="pnl-lbl">What are shock covers?</span>
		</a>
		<div id="panel14" class="content">
			Shock covers are essential motorbike plastics and protect the lower shock from road and track dirt.  This stops grit, dust, sand and salt entering this important area of your bike and causing serious damage.  Shock covers can extend the life of your shock absorber and are a basic bit of kit if you intend to use your bike off-road.  If dirt and track debris does get into your shock shafts then the up and down movement will rub the particles against the shafts causing them to become pitted.  This leads to a number of problems such as worn o-rings (these keep the shock oil in place) and poor performance. Shock covers are essential dirt bike plastics particularly if you regularly ride in very dusty, muddy or sandy conditions.

		</a>
		<div id="panel15" class="content">
			Shock covers are available in plastic kits and you can also get rubber/neoprene versions.   One drawback of rubber shock covers is that oil from the shocks can leak into the rubber causing them to become ‘sticky'. This will trap dirt, sand and grit inside the cover and they can fill up, pushing the debris into the shock shafts.  The plastic covers are much easier to clean and oil will just wipe away and will not trap dirt against the shock.

		</a>
		<div id="panel16" class="content">
			You do need to check your motocross plastics over carefully before every use.  Plastic fenders, shock covers and chain sliders can easily become damaged in rough off-road conditions and will need sorting out before you use the bike again.  You can tape up cracks and splits temporarily but replacement plastics for dirt bikes are widely available and affordable so it is best just to replace them with a new product.

		<div id="panel17" class="content">
			If you are entering into competitive events you may not be allowed to take part if your dirt bike plastics are in bad condition.   Make sure you have a few replacement plastic kits with you just in case your fenders, chain slider etc... become significantly damaged.  This will allow you to do last minute repairs so you can continue racing in the event of an accident.  You can get different replacement plastics for dirt bikes in kits for specific events such as motocross and enduro and these will provide you with everything you need.

		</a>
		<div id="panel18" class="content">
			There is a big debate in the off-road world about whether pressure washers are any good for cleaning down dirt bikes.  Pressure washers make quick work of caked on mud and grime but they can force water up into bushings, seals and mechanical motorcycle parts and cause lots of problems.  However a compromise can be achieved.  Take the side panels, fenders and other easily removable plastic parts off and use the pressure washer on these (and the wheels) to remove dirt.  Then use a bucket of warm water, a good quality car/bike wash and a sponge to work around key areas such as the shock and forks.  Motul Wash and Wax (or any other non-toxic and biodegradable cleaner) is a good option as it will not tarnish aluminium parts the way some strong autocare cleaners can.

		<div id="panel19" class="content">
			If you are using your dirt bike in clay soil terrains then the white sections get stained after a while.  You can remove this by using a strong cleaner such as Westleys Bleach White but make sure you avoid using this on any coloured plastics as this could fade them.  Don't use abrasive cleaners on motorbike plastics as this will just scratch the surface.

		</a>
		<div id="panel21" class="content">
			If you buy a Honda 125cc dirt bike there are a few simple steps you can take to make it road legal.  Firstly you will need a headlamp, tail light and you may need to buy a new plastics kit to accommodate these.  You will also need a speedometer, horn, indicators and at least a 12v battery.  Dirt bikes are designed to rev very high so you will need to drop the rear sprocket of your Honda 125cc in order to modify acceleration and increase top end speed.  The suspension will also need adjusting for comfort and agility on road conditions. All of the Honda parts you will need to turn your 125cc road legal are widely available from both independent suppliers and Honda dealers.

			Honda are a leading dirt bike manufacturer and have produced a number of different 125cc models over the years and the top speeds do vary.  The CR 125 model for example is very lightweight (just over 85 kilograms) and has a powerful 41-horsepower engine.  This means that that it can achieve an impressive top speed of just over 130km/ph in good conditions.

One major consideration is that if you want an electric start you do need a battery so you must choose the appropriate kit if your bike does not already have a battery.  You may find it difficult to get electric Honda motorcycle parts starter kits for the smaller bore bikes (400cc and below) though.

Top model choices for smaller adult riders include the CRF150F and a CRF230F.  These are popular options and are affordable and there are plenty of Honda motorcycle parts available for easy maintenance.

This is the bike of choice for the world's most challenging and hostile off road races such as those in Baja California.  Baja is very hot, dry and dusty and the hard rocky ground puts the frame and suspension of any bike to the test.  The Honda XR650R performs very well in these conditions and there are lots of replacement and aftermarket Honda parts available for this model.

Honda makes a wide range of off-road dirt bikes and many of the models are very similar in looks and style but have very different parts.  If you have the model number of your bike you can make sure you order the right Honda motorcycle parts and accessories.  The easiest way to find out the model number of your bike is to look at the frame.  All authentic Honda bikes have metal plates attached to the neck of the frame which states various details such as the model number. These numbers can be quite small and difficult to read though so you may find it easier to contact a certified Honda dirt bike dealer.  They will have complete lists of all the model numbers and will be able to tell you which model your bike is.  It is also a good idea to check through the paperwork for your bike and see if you have the original product manual as this will list the model number as well.

			If you want to add Honda Racing team colours to your dirt bike you can buy some excellent graphic kits from Honda parts suppliers.  These can be easy to fit but you do need to do the right preparation. Firstly the plastics need to be in good condition and you should consider replacing any that are chipped or cracked.  This can ruin the effect of the graphics and make them more difficult to fit. You can get some cost effective replacement plastics from suppliers.   To get started fitting your graphics you will need to remove any old stickers and thoroughly clean the surface of the plastics with hot soapy water.  Dry completely and then lay your graphics out ready to apply.  Use a hair dryer to gently warm the plastics and then peel back a small section of the sticker and press in place.  Then line the sticker up and slowly remove the rest of the backing and carefully smooth the sticker onto the surface of the plastics.  Work in one direction and squeeze out air bubbles as you go.  Once you have finished if you spot any air bubbles you can prick them gently with a pin and then smooth them over.

		</a>
		<div id="panel31" class="content">
			It can be difficult to get parts for older models of KTMs. When KTM first started making dirt track and enduro bikes the demand was not high and so the aftermarket companies didn't bother producing KTM parts and accessories for them after a few years.   Basically if you have a model dating back to the 1980's then parts would have stopped being produced by the 1990s.  However you may find some companies selling older KTM parts if you are lucky.  It is worth contacting a dealer as many modern parts will fit on older models as well.  You could also consider looking around the classified ads and seeing if you can find another bike as a donor model if parts are really scarce.

You do need to take care when buying any type of used dirt bikes to make sure you get a genuine and reliable bike.  A typical problem with used dirt bikes is that they have not been maintained or cleaned properly. This means dirt will have entered the shock, gearbox and engine causing oil leaks, sticking throttles and gearbox seizures.  Make sure you start the bike and give it a quick test run to ensure then engine, throttle, clutch and gear changes are smooth.  If the bike has any aftermarket KTM motorcycle parts ask for the receipts and check they are the genuine items.

Any more than this and the bearings will need replacing.   Check around the engine for any signs of oil leaks and also check the radiators for coolant leaks. Put the bike in neutral and start it up.  Check the engine is running smoothly and revving easily.  Listen out for any rattles or top end noise that could indicate potential problems.  Test the brakes and make sure they are still in good condition.  Replace worn pads before race day.

Taking off old plastics is easy with a hot air gun or good hair dryer.  All you need to do is heat the graphics for a few moments (make sure the air flow is not too hot).  This should cause the adhesive on the reverse of the graphics to warm and pull free so you should be able to peel them off without damaging the plastic.  Once you have taken off the old graphics you can clean the plastics thoroughly and put your new graphics on.  If any of the panels are chipped or scratched you should think about replacing them as this can spoil the look of your new graphics.  You can buy lots of replacement plastics and Suzuki parts online at affordable prices.

		</a>
		<div id="panel42" class="content">
			The plastic parts on dirt bikes are designed not just to look good but also to protect key areas of the bike from damage in the event of an off-road spill.  However this means they can easily get scratched, split and broken. You should replace damaged plastic panels, fenders and covers as soon as possible for a number of reasons.  Firstly they make your bike look old and tired. Secondly broken or split panels could expose more expensive parts to wear and damage.  Thirdly if you are racing you may not be allowed to take part if your bike is not in good condition as damaged plastics can break free during a race and cause hazards to other riders.  Replacement plastics and Suzuki motorcycle parts are widely available from both offline and online suppliers.

		<div id="panel43" class="content">
			You can buy graphics kits and other Suzuki parts online.  It can be tricky getting your new graphics set to fit smoothly first time and you may spot a few tiny bubbles across the plastics once you have finished.  These are easy to deal with and you simply take a pin and gently prick the bubble.  Now you can squeeze out the trapped air gently and the graphics will lay flat and smooth again.  A new set of graphics are a great way to freshen up your bike and give it a new racing look.
