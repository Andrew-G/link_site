		<div id="panel1a" class="content">
			The exhaust system on a motorbike is one of the most visible external parts of a bike and you can get a number of fancy chromed and coated aftermarket options that can really jazz up your bike's look.<br>
			These aftermarket parts are also designed to improve overall performance so are essential options for anyone who wants to maximise the potential of their motorbike.<br>
			Standard exhaust systems can sound a little tame so you can also improve the 'note' of your engine by upgrading the pipes to create a really powerful sound that will turn heads as much as the new look of the bike.<br>
			Upgrading a motorcycle exhaust system is fairly straightforward and there are some great products on offer from top manufacturers such as Cobra.

		<div id="panel1b" class="content">
You do not have to replace the whole motorcycle exhaust system in order to improve your bikes looks and performance. There are a number of great products on the market such as race cans, slip on mufflers and stunning double-chromed open mufflers (for cruisers) which can dramatically improve your exhaust system without having to spend a lot of money.<br>
			Changing the muffler or adding a race can is a simple job and you will only need a few basic tools.<br>
			This is a lot cheaper and easier than having your whole exhaust system replaced.

		</a>
		<div id="panel1c" class="content">
You can change an exhaust system at home as long as you have the right tools and a good mechanical skill level.<br>
			This is a great way of upgrading your bike without taking it into a professional garage and spending a lot of money. You can get some great Cobra exhaust system options and these can update the look of your bike and help boost overall performance.<br>
			It is a good idea to have a copy of your owner's manual with you when you change your exhaust system so you can clearly see all of the connection points for bolting the new exhaust to your frame. To start with, unbolt the old exhaust system and gaskets and set them aside for disposal. Carefully test fit the new system and make sure the pipes and gaskets all line up. Install the new gaskets and manifold and then bolt on the new pipes as per the guidance in your owner's manual. Slip the new mufflers in place and secure them to the pipes and frame. Make sure you torque all the bolts down to the right specifications (in the owner's manual).

You can buy some top quality performance exhaust systems from manufacturers such as Cobra.<br>
			These will be designed specifically to increase performance from your engine by boosting engine waste gas efficiency. Performance exhaust system options are also much lighter weight and this will provide an extra edge when it comes to performance.<br>
			On average performance exhaust systems have been shown to boost engine performance by as much as 10% (combined with an upgraded air filter) and you could also boost performance by 5% simply by changing the end can to a race version.

		<div id="panel1f" class="content">
One of the best things about a motorbike is the fact that you can see and hear the engine without too much metal or plastic getting in the way. Motorbikes provide a real connection between the rider and the machine.<br>
			The sound of a powerful bike opening up to release all that pent up horsepower is a great joy for any motor enthusiast. However standard mufflers can sometimes dampen the sound of the engine so it is a good idea to upgrade the exhaust system so you can unleash the real sound of your tuned, powerful engine.<br>
			Race exhaust systems are the best for improving the sound of your motorbike but they may not be road legal, so you may need to buy a silencer as well for when you are riding on the streets.

		<div id="panel1g" class="content">
The problem with road-legal exhaust systems from the factory is that they can look a bit bulky. This can detract from the clean lines of your motorbike.<br>
			You can buy some great aftermarket motorcycle exhaust pipes that offer slim outlines and stylish finishes which can drastically improve the look of your bike.

		<div id="panel1h" class="content">
Your exhaust system should last for a long time, however as this part of the bike is exposed to the elements it can wear more quickly. This is particularly true if you ride on salted winter roads which can cause a lot of corrosions to motorcycle exhaust pipes.<br>
			You should check your exhaust system over carefully every 6 months (or 5,000 miles whichever comes first) and make sure there are no signs of rust or wear.<br>
			You do not have to replace the system with an upgraded one if this is out of your budget as there are plenty of affordable standard replacement systems on the market.<br>
			Exhaust systems can also get damaged if you have a crash or drop your bike so make sure you check the bike over thoroughly after any incidents.

There are hundreds of different exhaust system options on the market from low-end replacement silencers for just a couple of hundred dollars through to full race-spec exhaust systems costing thousands of dollars.<br>
			The type of exhaust system you choose will depend on your budget but you should try and opt for a quality system from a leading manufacturer like Cobra if possible as these should last longer.

It will be much cheaper to replace your new exhaust system yourself and modern kits come with detailed instructions.<br>
			Anyone with a decent amount of garage space, good mechanical skills and a tool kit should be able to replace a motorcycle exhaust system as this is a fairly straightforward job.<br>
			However if you have a high performance sports bike with complicated features such as double silencers this can get a bit tricky and it may be best to pay for a professional to do this job.
